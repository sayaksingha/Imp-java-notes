Which of the following are valid?
  1. The purpose of the constructor is to create the object.
  2. The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the object,not to create the object.
  3. Once constructor completes then only object creation completes.
  4. First object will be created and then constructor will be executed.
  5. The purpose of the new keyword is to create object and the purpose of constructor is to
     initalize the object.
  6. We can't create Object for abstract class directly but indirectly we can create.
  7. Whenever we are creating child class object automatically parent class object will be
     created.
  8. Whenever we are creating child class object automatically abstract class constructor will
     be executed.
  9. Whenever we are creating child class object automatically parent  constructor will
     be executed but parent object wont be created.
  10.Either directly or indirectly we can't create Object for abstract class and hence constructor
     concept is not applicable for abstract class.
  11.Interface can contain constructor.
