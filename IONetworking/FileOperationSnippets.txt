Constructors of File class
==========================
 File f=new File(String fname)
 File f=new File(String directoryName,String fileName);
 File f=new File(File f,String fileName);


Requirement
=> Write code to create a file named with demo.txt in current working directory. 
		cwd
		 |=> abc.txt

Requirement
=> Write code to create a directory named with IPLTeam in current working directory and create a      file named with abc.txt in that directory. 
		 cwd
		   |=> IPLTeam
			  |=> abc.txt

Requirement: 
=> Write code to create a file named with rcb.txt present in D:\IPLTeam folder. 
			D

 2. write(char[] ch);
 3. write(String data);
 4. flush()
 5. close()

FileReader
==========
Constructors
   1.FileReader fr=new FileReader(String name); 
   2.FileReader fr=new FileReader (File f);

Methods
 1. int read()
 2. int read(char[] ch)
 3. void close()

BufferedWriter:
    It can't communicate with the file directly, it can communicate only with writer Object.

Constructor
   BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(writer w);
   BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(writer w,int buffersize);

Which of the following declarations are valid? 
1. BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter("cricket.txt"); 
2. BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter (new File("cricket.txt")); 
3. BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter (new FileWriter("cricket.txt")); 
4. BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("crickter.txt")));  
 
Methods
========
1. write(intch);
2. write(char[] ch);
3. write(String s);
4. flush();
5. close();
6. newLine(); 
	Inserting a new line character to the file.

BufferedReader
==============
 Constructors:
	BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(Reader r);
	BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(Reader r,int buffersize); 

Methods:
1. int read();
2. int read(char[] ch);
3. String readLine(); 
4. void close();

PrintWriter
==========
 Constructors:
PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(String name);
PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(File f);
PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(Writer w);

Methods:
1. write(intch);
2. write (char[] ch);
3. write(String s);
4. flush();
5. close();

6. print(char ch);
7. print (int i);
8. print (double d);
9. print (boolean b);
10.print (String s);
11.println(char ch);
12.println (int i);
13.println(double d);
14.println(boolean b);
15.println(String s);

Note 1: 
1. The most enhanced Reader to read character data from the File is BufferedReader.
2. The most enhanced Writer to write character data to the File is PrintWriter.

Note 2:
1.In general we can use Readers and Writers to handle character data. Where as we can use            InputStreams and OutputStreams to handle binary data(like images, audio files, video files etc).
2. We can use OutputStream to write binary data to the File and we can use InputStream to read       binary data from the File
Character Data => Reader and Writer
Binary Data    => InputStream and OutputStream

Note 3:
                  Object
                    |
                  Writer				   Reader
		    |                                        |
